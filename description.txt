Description of the files contained in 'tetris':

agent_		DQN structure with main training loop and testing
tetris_		respective tetris version

advanced	advanced reward function
random		agent executing random actions (baseline)
short		limited number of pieces per game including increment
simple		simple reward function
simplegame	random tetromino and random rotation, action is move left or right and hard drop
simplestgame	BlockDrop
whole		whole board as input state


grouped_	same as above but implemented with grouped actions, only training
_test_		main testing loop, including import of relevant model

all		normal (full) Tetris game		-> all_drop_ .pt
simple		JDrop					-> J_drop_ .pt
simplest	BlockDrop				-> block_drop_ .pt

(.pt files are saved models (parameters of network))
